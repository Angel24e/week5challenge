# Work Day Schedular

## Description

Hi this project I was supposed to add a couple of features to this website.

I used some jquery and dayjs to display the date and time at the top of the screen and color code the text boxes based on the hour of the day blue-past red-present green-future.

I also added the feature of saving any text written in the textbox in the local storage and the text remains when the page is refreshed.

## Third-party-apis

I used
- Jquery 
- dayjs
